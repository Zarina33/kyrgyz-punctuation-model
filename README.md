# Kyrgyz Punctuation Model

## Overview

This repository contains a **punctuation restoration model for the Kyrgyz language**, trained on the **XLM-RoBERTa-base** pre-trained transformer model. The model is designed to automatically insert punctuation marks into Kyrgyz text, improving readability and downstream natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as speech recognition, machine translation, and text summarization.

## Features

- Fine-tuned on Kyrgyz language data for punctuation restoration.
- Based on the multilingual XLM-RoBERTa transformer architecture.
- Supports common punctuation marks relevant to Kyrgyz.
- Helps enhance NLP pipelines by adding punctuation to raw text.

## Repository Contents

- Model training and evaluation scripts.
- Preprocessing utilities tailored for Kyrgyz text.
- Trained model checkpoints (if available).
- Documentation and usage examples.

## Background

Kyrgyz is a less-resourced language with unique linguistic characteristics, including agglutinative morphology and free word order, which pose challenges for NLP tasks. Punctuation restoration is essential for improving the quality of automatic speech recognition outputs and other text generation systems.

This model contributes to the Kyrgyz NLP ecosystem by providing a robust tool for punctuation prediction, leveraging advances in multilingual transformer models.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zarina33/kyrgyz-punctuation-model.git
cd kyrgyz-punctuation-model
```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

- **Training the model:**

```bash
python train.py --config config.yaml
```

- **Evaluating the model:**

```bash
python evaluate.py --model checkpoints/best_model.pt --data data/test_data.txt
```

- **Predicting punctuation on new text:**

```bash
python predict.py --model checkpoints/best_model.pt --input input.txt --output output.txt
```
